Notice
------

Versions 1.x will support MooTools 1.2.x while 2.x will support 1.3.x.
If you are using version 1.x, you'll need version 1.2.4 or greater of mootools-core because the plugin uses Browser.Engine.gecko engine detection, which just work on those versions.

How to use
----------
	<html>
		<head>
			<!--include mootools library and meioMask plugin -->
			<script type="text/javascript" src="mootools-core-1.3.0.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
			<!-- Just Element.Form is needed -->
			<script type="text/javascript" src="mootools-more-1.3.0.1.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		</head>
	
		<body>
			<form>
				<label for="cpf">Time Mask:</label>
				<input type="text" name="time" data-meiomask="fixed.time" />
			</form>

			<script type="text/javascript" >
				$$('input').each(function(input){
					input.meiomask(input.get('data-meiomask'));
