Things i don't like about it (will change till version 2.0):


* Some crazy if's - This will need a total rewrite from the plugin;
* Mask types should have in some way, different options for each of them, i mean, they should be threated separately, each of theyres event. It's being done right now... but i feel that it can be even better;
* Try not to polute the native objects with crazy and unusefull methods;
* Make a cool and correct unmaskedVal function;
* Work correctly with float and integer numbers, i mean like... if 90 is the value of the input it will mask to 90.00 not 0.90;
* New mask type that works like this:
	mask='9-9' and maxlength=5
	'22' -> '2-2'
	'222' -> '22-2'
	'2222' -> '222-2'
	Till it gets to 5.
* RegexMask should be included too, it is still here at the mootools version, but with the paste bug, that will be easily fixed with the maxLength option, that will not be optional (can't force it but it will break paste if not present);
* Try to add a placeholder option, not that necessary but it would be nice; IT IS STILL THERE!
* Change the way signed masks work! That's so not pretty!;
* Watch for a better fix on maxLength (try to avoid that maxLength == -1).

IDEAS FOR 2.0:

* Set defaultValue when the mask is applyed to fix the reset buton of the form; OK
* Option that will set the size attribute of the input based on the mask; OK
* As seen on the benchmarks i did, i should consider using a string of characters instead of a regular expression; OK
* Add a callback to rules so that it can get uppercased or lowercased after inputting the char, this will allow a char being dependent of a preceding char (like on hours you dont want the user to input chars bigger than 3 if the first is 2) 
* Option to force the completition of the value of the mask.
